aws_instance.ec2 (remote-exec): To run Docker as a non-privileged user, consider setting up the

aws_instance.ec2 (remote-exec):     dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install

aws_instance.ec2 (remote-exec): Visit https://docs.docker.com/go/rootless/ to learn about rootless mode.


aws_instance.ec2 (remote-exec): To run the Docker daemon as a fully privileged service, but granting non-root
